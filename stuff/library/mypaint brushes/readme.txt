will not be installed with this brush pack. Check the wiki/forum for

Hiphei!

This pack includes Tone's Brush Set Version 2 and settings.conf 
= Global Pressure Mapping.

All brushes and "values for Global Pressure Mapping" are 
made by Tone aka Creativetone aka Luovatone

There is 124 MyPaint Brushes for Nokia N900.. 

.. these are also tested with Wacom Cintiq 12wx and they work almost identically..
but this set works "much" better with N900 Touch Screen.

They all are carefully "calibrated to use "included" (settings.conf)
global pressure mapping values".

Take notice that this set is made for "my" style...

Brushes works in "many levels of pressure".. so sometimes...
it is good to use fingers or something bigger than small stylus tip for
drawing and painting.

And now Let's focusing some Art Making... plaah..
This is quite "hard" but fun work with.

Thanks!

Tone aka Creativetone aka Luovatone
